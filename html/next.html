<h1>Where do we go from here?</h1>

<p>
The goal of this project was to demonstrate an easy implementation
of LISP. There is not much point in optimizing or mindlessly
implementing library functions &mdash; this work has already been
done in other projects.
</p>

<p>
Here are some possible extensions which might prove interesting:
<ul>
  <li>Expose continuations with <code>call/cc</code></li>
  <li>Other numeric types (float, rational, bignum, complex)</li>
  <li>String, vector and boolean types</li>
  <li>I/O support</li>
  <li>Calls to system libraries</li>
  <li>JIT (integrate with LLVM, for example)</li>
  <li>Slab allocation</li>
  <li>Alternative GC</li>
</ul>
</p>

<p>
Now it's time to stop messing about in C and build something in LISP instead!
</p>

<p>
That's all, folks.
